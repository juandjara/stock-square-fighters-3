# Stock Square Fighters

This is the third version of the same concept of a 2d fighting game with stock photos

The [first version](https://github.com/juandjara/stock-square-fighters) was never completed, but there, the concept was born, long time ago.

The [second version](https://github.com/juandjara/stock-square-fighters-2), a [phaser](https://phaser.io) project, was created not so long ago, with an idea for the player selection and voice selection UI, but gameplay was not finished either

This version, a [godot game](https://godotengine.org/) has a complete gameplay, and more pulished mechanics, but it is still lacking in the sound aspect.

To run this version, you can go to this URL: https://www.djara.dev/stock_square_fighters

To run this version locally, download the repo and import it into the godot game engine.
